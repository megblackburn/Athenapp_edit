- have created a new input file in probsmeg called athinput.khturb
- have copied the github files for mix_layer_shift - copied_tcm.cpp, hst_func, townsend_cooling_max and code_units
- need to have -mpi in the command line for MPI_PARALLEL to be used
- runs into error in last runs of the cpp file so have added text debugging to find where it stops - syntax error i think
- gets to line 672 but not further - need more debugging

14.08.23
- still not working when take lines after 672 out of if statement - error within this section
- error after line 690 - phydro? all variables are defined - double check that the calculated variables dont have syntax errors 
- unsure where phydro pccord
